# Streamlined-Dataflow-FPGA-Architectures-for-RCs-in-Time-Series-Applications

It is the first quantized streamline Reservoir Computing (RC), in particular, Echo State Networks (ESNs). However, it can be easily extended to other variation of RC, which is supported by ReservoirPy

Python 3.9+ (recommended)

Recommended libraries (edit based on your project):

numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib

scikit-learn

reservoirpy (if used)

torch + brevitas (if quantization is used)

onnx, onnxruntime (if export/evaluation is included)
